A collection of my Machine Learning - learning notebooks and projects which includes hands-on practice, algorithms, and real-world ML projects.

Machine Learning Repository

This repository contains 2 Folder name called,
1. ML_learning
2. ML_Projects,
and it contains everything I’m learning and building in Machine Learning.

It’s divided into two main folders:

#📂 Folder Structure
- **Machine-Learning/** → This Folder Contains all my learning notebooks, Hands-on experiments, and algorithms.
  
- **Projects/** → Contains full ML projects with real datasets and Training the model and make model to prediction.
